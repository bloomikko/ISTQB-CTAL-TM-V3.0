# International Software Testing Qualifications Board (ISTQB) Advanced Level Test Management (CTAL-TM) v3.0 notes
In this repository, you can find my personal notes and definitions for the ISTQB Advanced Level Test Management (CTAL-TM) v3.0. The certification and its syllabus is part of ISTQB's Advanced certification series, with an emphasis on test management and its activities. My personal study technique includes reading the syllabus material and making at the same time my own personal notes about it, which I use for revising for the exam.

Please note that this repository's information is based on **v3.0** syllabus &rarr;Â it can and most likely will alter in the future - these materials most likely will become obsolete over time. I still hope these notes offer some assistance - good luck with the exam!

## Practice exams
**Please note that these materials likely reflect the previous syllabi as the version 3.0 is relatively recent, thus containing questions which are not in the scope of v3.0 syllabus.** I personally felt that the old syllabus and questions based on that were obsolete, thus I recommend studying the first two resources above. You can still use resources below to complement your knowledge.
